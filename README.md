# Tech-doc-page
A technical documentation page done as a project for www.freecodecamp.org

## A live example of a finished project
A live example of what a finished project should look like can be found [here on CodePen]( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL)

### Required user stories
**These are the requirements the project must meet in order to be complete**
1.  I can see a main element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
2. Within the `#main-doc` element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
3. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
4. Each section element with the class of `main-section` should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="Javascript_and_Java"`).
5. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least 10 `p` elements total (not each).
6. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least 5 `code` elements total (not each).
7. The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 `li` items total (not each).
8. I can see a nav element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`.
9.  The `navbar` element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
10.  Additionally, the `navbar` should contain link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`.
11. The `header` element in the navbar must come before any link (`a`) elements in the navbar.
12. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
13. When I click on a `navbar` element, the page should navigate to the corresponding `section` of the `main-doc` element (e.g. If I click on a `nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element that has that `id` and contains the corresponding header.
14. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
15. My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
